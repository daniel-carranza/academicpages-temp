I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University interested in homotopy theory, (higher) category theory, and graph theory.

Previously, I was a Program Associate at SLMath (formerly MSRI) during the 2022-23 academic year. I obtained my Master's degree from the University of Toronto in 2022. Before that, I was an undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.
